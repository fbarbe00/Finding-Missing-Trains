# Visualisations

This folder contains code for 2 different kinds of visualisations: Isochrones and Time-Distorted Maps. For scripts to collect the data, see the `commuting_times` folder.

The two notebooks for computing the isochrones and time distorted maps are `isochrones.ipynb` and `distorted_maps.ipynb` respectively.

Additionally, the notebook `plot_shapefiles.ipynb` can be used to visualise intermediate shapefiles interactively.
